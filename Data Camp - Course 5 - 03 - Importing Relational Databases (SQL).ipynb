    "#$ RELATIONAL DATABASES:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) INTRODUCTION \n",
    "\n",
    "    ## What is a realtional database ? Example of Company's order book database (Order Table, Customer table and employee table)\n",
    "\n",
    "        # based on realtional model of data. first described by \"Tedd\" Codd in late 1960s\n",
    "        # Example we have Database consisting of many tables (like Order Table, customer table and employees table) \n",
    "        # These tables are analogous to  dataframes (with unqiue keys (to access rows, ex: Order Id in order table) and there attributes.\n",
    "        # Tables in realtional databases are unique because they are linked.\n",
    "        # For example : via the order id key we can access the Order Table, which also has Customer_id and employee_id information\n",
    "        # .. which can be used as keys to access Cusomter Table and Employee table for any further information (called query)\n",
    "        # So given an order ID, we can immediate look up the relevant customer and employee information, \n",
    "        # .. this means we dont need to store all the customer and employee inforamtion (ex there names etc) \n",
    "        # .. information in the order table, we can just pass a query to look it up in relational databases.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ## Relational Model used in Relational databases is summarized in Codd's 12 rules/ commandments \n",
    "        # Consist of 13 rules - as first rule is indexed 0. haha..\n",
    "        # These rules describe what the relational database management system should adhere to to be considered relational\n",
    "        \n",
    "    ## Common Relational Database Management Systems all of which use Sequal query language  \n",
    "        # PostgresSQL\n",
    "        # MySQL\n",
    "        # SQLite\n",
    "        # .... where SQL is acronyn for structured Query Language which describes how to communicate with a database to access and update it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Basic Querying : QUerying individual tables of relational databases \n",
    "\n",
    "    # What we need is to get out data from a database using SQL that is structured query language\n",
    "    # There are several way : \n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Method 1 : Workflow of such a process via data base engine creation and opening connections \n",
    "            \n",
    "            # Step 1 : Import packages and functions\n",
    "            # Step 2 : Create the data base engine and look at the tables contained\n",
    "            # Step 3 : Connect to the engine \n",
    "            # Step 4 : Query the database (getting all or specific columns of specific tables and ordering the SQL records via ORDER BY)\n",
    "            # Step 5 : Save results of the query to the dataframe\n",
    "            # Step 6 : Close the connection\n",
    "        \n",
    "         # Method 2 : Work flow of alternative process via context manager to open connection\n",
    "            \n",
    "            #  open the connection via context manager, rest same as Method 1 to do query process\n",
    "\n",
    "         # Method 3 :  Querying the relational databases directly with pandas\n",
    "            \n",
    "            # converts the 4 line of code required to query the database by context manager to store as dataframe to just one line\n",
    "            # After creating engine (Step 1 -3 of Method 1)\n",
    "            # 1 line code for querying using pandas : df = pd.read_sql_query(\"SQL QUery to execute\", engine)\n",
    "            ## .... first argument is the SQL query we need to execute\n",
    "            ## ... second argument is the engine we want to connect to\n",
    "            \n",
    "### 3) Advanced Querying : Exploiting Linked Table Relationships - the real usecase of relational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Example querying multiple tables via their keys which correspond to coloumns in originally accessed data table\n",
    "        # Example get the order ID to access Orders Table \n",
    "        # .. and then use Customer ID and Employee ID from it as keys to access Customer and Employee table information \n",
    "        # JOINing the queried data -- example of INNER JOIN here\n",
